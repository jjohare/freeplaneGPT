## Mindmap Generator with GPT-3

This Python script processes a list of tasks, each containing a URL, to generate a mindmap. It utilizes GPT-3 to categorize the tasks and provide summaries. The script performs the following actions:

1. Reads tasks from a JSON file.
2. Extracts the URL from each task title.
3. Fetches metadata (title and description) for each URL, which is used to update the task title.
4. Reads a list of topics from a CSV file.
5. Fetches the text content from each URL, limiting it to 3000 characters.
6. Sends the text content to GPT-3, requesting a summary and a categorization based on the predefined list of topics.
7. Updates an existing mindmap XML file (FreeMind format) with the generated summaries and categories.
8. Saves the modified mindmap to a new XML file.

The resulting mindmap is organized with tasks grouped under their respective categories, each task containing a summary generated by GPT-3.
